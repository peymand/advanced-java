Lambda Expressions and Functional Interfaces

Inner Classes(https://www.baeldung.com/java-nested-classes):
    Static nested classes
    Non-static nested classes
    Local classes
    Anonymous classes

Stream
Stream operations are either intermediate or terminal.
Most stream operations accept some kind of lambda expression parameter, a functional interface specifying the exact behavior of the operation.
intermediate operations will only be executed when a terminal operation is present.
